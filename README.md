Welcome to my Deep learning project on Nigerian Cousine recognition using Fast.ai and Pytorch
 
Problem statement: A lot of Nigerians, home and in diaspora have trouble recognizing their dishes, this is as a result of the diveresed culture in Nigeria, and each culture has its own norms, food, belief etc. 
The goal of this task was to efficiently and effectively classify Nigerian food cousine by taking a photograph of it and uploading to the server.

The dataset for this project was manually created by googling up images of different cousines using the google Image website and also taking photographs of food prepared by myself and other collegues of mine.

A total of 20 different Food cousines were arranged namely:

    Rice and stew
    Jollof rice
    Ofe Nsala (White soup)
    Egusi soup
    Draw soup
    Ewedu soup
    Ofe Akwu (palm oil soup)
    Akara
    Moi moi
    Bitter leaf soup (ofe Onugbu)
    Nkwobi (pepper soup/goat meat)
    Ora soup
    Suya
    Kilishi
    Zobo
    Beans and Yam
    Yam Porridge
    Noodles
    Shawarma
    Soaking garri

Each of this data array contained over 150 images and a total of over 3000 images with size of 700+MB. The images are hosted online on my private server and are available for public use on request.

The model got an accuracy of 82% and the model used was VGG16. I so much love VGG... It is very aggressive!
